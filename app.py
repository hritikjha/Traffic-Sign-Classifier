After that we explored,summarized and visualized the data set .Design, training and testing of the model architecture occured after we had visualized the whole data set. Then, we used the model to make predictions on new images and analyse the probabilities of the new image. Finally we test the model with a data set.And deployed the project to make an interactive web app using  streamlit.')
